Feature:
	As a tester, I want to be assured that a test environment is both
	accessible and available

#  Background:

#  Scenario:
#    The target test environment (as defined in $TST_TGT_ENV) is accessible
#
#    Given that the target test environment is correctly defined
#    When I attempt to verify the VPN tunnel
#    Then I expect the VPN tunnel to exist
#    When I attempt to access a known end-point
#    Then I expect the end-point to respond

#  @wip
#  Scenario:
#    Given I want to ensure that an environment is on-air
#    When I attempt to validate the environment
#    Then I expect the environment to be available
#    And I expect the environment to respond
